# Greetings! I'm Konstantin Kovalev aka Constantiner 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to my realm of coding magic and gaming quests:

- 🛠️ **Code Alchemist**: I mix TypeScript, React, Next.js and Node.js to conjure up robust web applications. Coding isn’t just my job; it’s my spellcraft!
- 🧩 **Puzzle Solver**: From debugging to full-stack development, I love untangling complex code puzzles.
- 🎮 **Dungeon Master**: Not just a coder—I'm a master of Nintendo games, always ready for a Mario Kart duel.
- 🚀 **Innovation Explorer**: Experimenting with new tech through pet projects, I’m constantly on a quest for the latest and greatest.
- 🌐 **Remote Sorcerer**: With a decade of remote work, I've perfected my spells for seamless online collaboration.

**Questing for New Adventures**: I'm open to joining a new guild where my coding magic can make a difference. Check out my [resume](Konstantin%20Kovalev%20Full-stack%20Developer.pdf) for more.
