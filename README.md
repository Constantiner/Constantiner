# Greetings! I'm Konstantin Kovalev üëã

I‚Äôm a seasoned Full-Stack Developer with over 15 years of experience in crafting web solutions that effectively integrate front-end development with robust back-end systems. My focus is on building scalable, maintainable applications using TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Node.js.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Full-Stack Expert**: I specialize in delivering end-to-end solutions, from intuitive user interfaces to complex server-side logic, ensuring user and business needs are met.

- üöÄ **Tech Innovator**: I continuously explore the latest advancements and enjoy experimenting with new tools and frameworks to keep my skills sharp.

- üß© **Problem Solver**: I thrive on tackling challenging problems, whether optimizing performance or implementing cutting-edge features.

- üåê **Remote Work Veteran**: With more than a decade of remote work experience, I excel in self-management and effective online collaboration.

## Featured Projects

- **[Monovitality](https://github.com/Constantiner/monovitality)**: A TypeScript-based monorepo offering opinionated solutions for advanced front-end development challenges with React. This project features tools like Lerna and NPM workspaces for monorepo management, Vite for development, Storybook for component isolation, and Gatsby for static site generation. It‚Äôs a comprehensive starter template for managing complex web applications.

- **[Zohar](https://github.com/Constantiner/zohar)**: A functional, type-safe event emitter library with zero dependencies. Named after both the Xeno series and Kabbalistic tradition, `Zohar` provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for emitting and handling events across different parts of your application. It ensures that emitted events match expected data types, making it an ideal tool for managing event-driven architectures in a reliable and structured way.

- **[Oktolity (Work in Progress)](https://github.com/Constantiner/oktolity)**: A T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth.js) full-stack application designed to manage GitHub repositories and starred items. This project leverages the power of the T3 stack, providing a simple yet scalable foundation for expanding functionality over time.

- **[Planet List Flex 4](https://github.com/Constantiner/planet-list-flex-4)**: A legacy Adobe Flex 4 project from 2010, preserved as an interesting artifact of outdated technology. Back then, I was a big enthusiast and evangelist of Rich Internet Applications (RIA), which we now refer to as Single Page Applications (SPA). This project demonstrates the solid technical foundations and advanced features of the time, including a robust build pipeline and unit tests. It showcases the power of Flex 4‚Äôs layout architecture, using the Solar System‚Äôs planets to illustrate custom data control capabilities. I‚Äôve archived this project on GitHub to maintain a piece of web development history, offering a glimpse into past technologies for those who appreciate such relics.

- **[Resolve Node Configs Hierarchy](https://github.com/Constantiner/resolve-node-configs-hierarchy)**: A simple yet powerful library designed to manage and resolve configuration files hierarchically in Node.js projects. It supports environments like development, testing, and production, automatically applying the correct configuration files. Allowing local configurations that aren‚Äôt committed to version control helps prevent sensitive environment variables like API keys and passwords from leaking into public repositories, making it ideal for projects that require different setups across environments. The library offers synchronous and asynchronous methods to retrieve the most relevant configuration files, simplifying the management of complex setups in any Node.js project.

- **[Fun-ctional](https://github.com/Constantiner/fun-ctional)**: A versatile library that brings familiar functional programming techniques, like composition and mapping, into the asynchronous world of JavaScript. With `fun-ctional`, you can seamlessly mix synchronous and asynchronous functions to create reusable and composable functions. This library is compatible with traditional functional utilities like those in Lodash, but always returns promises, making it ideal for modern JavaScript applications that rely on async/await. Key utilities include `acompose` for async composition, `apipe` for async piping, and `amap` for asynchronous mapping over iterables.

I‚Äôm currently open to new opportunities where I can apply my skills to create impactful software.
